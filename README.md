# Loan_SQL_Exploration
Loan exploration with SQL and Python
1. What is the average loan term (in months) for each agent?
2. What is the percent of loans that have been charged off for each team (a charge off occurs
no later than 150 days past due, and the loan must have been in default status)?
3. What is the total number of loans that have been decisioned by agents in each skill level
(beginner, medium, advanced) who have worked for more than 60 days in that new skill? (In
other words, exclude loans decisioned within the first 60 days of an agent working in a new skill
level).
